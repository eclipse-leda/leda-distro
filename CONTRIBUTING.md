# Contributing to Eclipse Leda

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

In the ambition to build a technology ecosystem for software-defined vehicle,
one of the main challengs will be the combination of the diverse components into
a coherent and useful whole: all the software components in the world will not
have the impact needed to transform the automotive industry unless we can make
them play together coherently an form a functional portfolio.

As a first step towards that goal, Eclipse Leda provides an "SDV distribution" that pulls
together individual contributor pieces from SDV and the larger OSS community, to
deliver a functional and always-available Linux-based image/distribution with
two primary goals: 

1. being the crystalization point for functionally integrating
diverse SDV-scope projects into a working whole 
2. delivering a continuously
available, always working starting image for developers interested in getting
going with the SDV tech stack

### Background

The newly instantiated Eclipse SDV
working group is currently gearing up to receive a first batch of project
proposals for technology building blocks that will begin to populate the
landscape of what will become an SDV ecosystem. The mid-term goal is to form a
technology ecosystem, where a myriad of projects and companies contribute
diverse functional additions around a set of core APIs, extension points and
integration patterns. To enable developers and users of the SDV ecosystem, an
SDV distribution is expected to help integrating several individual components
and various other open-source projects to a ready-to-use development environment
for new and existing components, as well as creating a basis for
automotive-grade, production-ready SDV solutions.

### Scope

The Eclipse Leda project will provide system image "recipes" to deliver a functional
Linux-based image/distribution in the context of SDV (Software Defined Vehicle),
by pulling together individual contributons from the SDV and the larger OSS
community.

The Eclipse Leda distribution will work with build scripts, package
definitions, image build pipelines, etc, with the goal to pull SDV projects and
dependecies from the larger OSS community into a working Linux system. Such
system images (or other useful forms of delivery, as determined by the project)
will be made available for consumption for anyone who is interested in working
with the SDV tech stack. These deliveries take the form of container (base)
images, installable/flashable image files, etc (again to be evolved by the
project team according to community needs). Also in scope is concise and useful
documentation for consumers of the project's deliverables, plus a method of
delivering that documentation.

### Description

In the context described above - the
ambition of SDV to build a technology ecosystem for software-defined vehicle
concern - a prime challenge will be the combination of these initially diverse
components into a coherent and useful whole: all the software components in the
world will not have the impact needed to transform the automotive industry
unless we can make them play together coherently an form a functional portfolio.
As a first step towards that goal, this proposal (Eclipse Leda) is for a "SDV
distribution" project that pulls together individual contributor pieces from SDV
and the larger OSS community, to deliver a functional and always-available
Linux-based image/distribution with two primary goals:

1. be the crystalization point for functionally integrating diverse SDV-scope projects into a working whole
2. deliver a continually available, always working starting image for developers interested in getting going with the SDV tech stack

### Why Eclipse?

The Eclipse Leda project aims to become the integration point for individual
SDV-related projects, so it only makes sense in the scope of the Eclipse SDV
working group. At the same time, it could be a driving force for showcasing SDV
to the wider communtiy, and for providing a great onboarding experience to
SDV-driven technology.
